# *Get Fluffy!*

Hopefully an entry in [IFComp 2020](https://ifcomp.org/).

[Play now on GitHub Pages](https://stone1343.github.io/get-fluffy/public/index.html) (Desktop browser recommended)

If you've downloaded the project from GitHub, navigate to the public directory and open index.html with whichever brower you prefer.

*Get Fluffy!* seems to work on iOS or Android, but I think you'll have a better experience on a modern desktop browser.
Being designed to play in a browser, *Get Fluffy!* can do things that would not be possible using Glulxe alone.
It is not intended to be played with Glulxe -- it will not work properly, but more importantly, you won't get the proper experience.

You don't need to compile or build anything, everything you need is provided, all ready to go. If you do want to build *Get Fluffy!*, you'll need the Inform 6 compiler and Lua interpreter.

On Windows, you can:
* **compile**, create the game files
* **play**, open public\index.html with your default browser

On Linux, you can:
* **make**
* **./play**, open public/index.html with your default browser

Some known inconsistencies:
* Britney doesn't have a smartphone.
* Why does it seem like you're entering every room for the first time? Do you have amnesia? No, it just seems to fit the paradigm of IF games.
* Britney moves between floors without using the elevator as if there were stairs, but there are none.
