Some known inconsistencies: Britney doesn't have a smartphone

Resolve the stairs and their doors, including print "I open the door to the stairs using the master key..."

Some Hotel_Room objects have random descriptions, have Do Not Disturb or are locked from the inside

Britney, look around - probably not

Make sure dropping an object leaves it in the right place, Kaitlyn or Britney (OnPhone)

Other verbs - If I know about fluffy, Not the time for that, else, do some

Selfie verb

give smartphone to anyone - "I think about giving my cellphone to ____ but decide to hang on to it."

Photograph us - Something lame like "This stupid phone can only take a picture of one person at a time"
