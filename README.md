Some known inconsistencies:
* Britney doesn't have a smartphone
* Why does it seem like you're entering every room for the first time? Do you have amnesia? No, it just seems to fit the paradigm of IF games.
* Britney moves between floors without using the elevator as if there were stairs, but there are none

""Get Fluffy!"* has not been tested on iOS or Android, please use a desktop browser.
