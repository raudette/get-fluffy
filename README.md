Some known inconsistencies:
* Britney doesn't have a smartphone
* Why does it seem like you're entering every room for the first time? Do you have amnesia? No, it just seems to fit the paradigm of IF games.
* Britney moves between floors without using the elevator but there's no stairs

Resolve the stairs and their doors, including print "I open the door to the stairs using the master key..."

Some Hotel_Room objects have random descriptions, have Do Not Disturb or are locked from the inside

Britney, look around - probably not

Make sure dropping an object leaves it in the right place, Kaitlyn or Britney (OnPhone)

Other verbs - If I know about fluffy, Not the time for that, else, do some

Selfie verb

give smartphone to anyone - "I think about giving my cellphone to ____ but decide to hang on to it."

Photograph us - Something lame like "This stupid phone can only take a picture of one person at a time"
