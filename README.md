*Get Fluffy!* has not been tested on iOS or Android, please use a desktop browser.
It is not intended to be played with Glulxe, it will not work properly, but more importantly, you won't get the proper experience.

You don't need to compile or build anything, everything you need is provided, all ready to go. If you do want to build *Get Fluffy!*, you'll need the Inform compiler and Lua interpreter.

On Windows, you can:
* **clean**, delete the game files

Some known inconsistencies:
* Britney doesn't have a smartphone.
* Why does it seem like you're entering every room for the first time? Do you have amnesia? No, it just seems to fit the paradigm of IF games.
* Britney moves between floors without using the elevator as if there were stairs, but there are none.
